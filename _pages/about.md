**李想**，哈尔滨工业大学（深圳）机器人与先进制造学院在读研究生。2024年获得哈尔滨工业大学（深圳）自动化专业学士学位（导师：[李衍杰教授](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/liyanjie)），2024年至今哈尔滨工业大学（深圳）控制科学与工程专业硕士研究生在读（导师：[李衍杰教授](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/liyanjie)，[楼云江教授](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/louyunjiang)）。研究方向为智能驾驶决策规划与控制，端到端的智能驾驶，模仿学习等。机器人领域顶会IROS2025在投论文2篇。

**Xiang Li** is a master's student at the School of Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Yanjie Li](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/liyanjie). Since 2024, he has been pursuing a Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering at the same institution, supervised by [Prof. Yanjie Li](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/liyanjie) and [Prof. Yunjiang Lou](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/louyunjiang). His research interests include decision-making, planning, and control for autonomous driving, end-to-end autonomous driving, and imitation learning. He has submitted two papers to IROS 2025, a top-tier conference in the field of robotics.

研究经历
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

<!-- **Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
